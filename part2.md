You can Make files in the terminal and access them easily via the terminal. In this tutorial I will show short steps on how to make a file regardless of it's type.

### 1. Open the Terminal: 
you can access the terminal via the the windows search bar and type terminal. 
### 2. Choose your directory or make it: 
Check the directory if it is the right then check it's content.
```bash
pwd
mkdir directory-name 
cd directory-name
ls 
```
### 3. Now create the file:
***please*** double check your directory and make sure it's the right directory and no file have the same name with the same datatype that you want to create. 

```bash 
touch index.html \css\style.css 
```
you can create files without changing the directory but you must target the correct path so this approach is not recommended.
